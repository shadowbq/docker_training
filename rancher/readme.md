# Rancher

Rancher Labs introduced two main tools: Rancher, a container management platform for Docker container systems, and RancherOS, a Linux operating system distribution simplified to host containers

## Rancher

Rancher is a management platform for Docker containers. It includes a Kubernetes distribution as well as the option to choose from Docker Swarm and Apache Mesos. These all use Docker as the underlying container runtime and coordinate running containers between multiple discrete physical nodes. Rancher also includes modular infrastructure services including networking, load balancing, service discovery, monitoring and recovery.

## RancherOS

RancherOS is a minimized version of Linux focused on hosting Docker containers, including only the bare minimum amount of software needed to run Docker. This keeps the binary download of RancherOS very small. Everything else can be pulled in dynamically through Docker when needed.[7][8] Rancher Labs announced version 1.0 in April 2017.[9] RancherOS is open source and can be downloaded from GitHub.
