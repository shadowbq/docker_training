# CoreOS

CoreOS is a *cloud-ready* operating system that uses a *cloud-config.yaml* standard for boot prep.

## History

The CoreOS is the OS orginially with rkt.io (rocket.io) a docker competitor, but its a solid implementation of the *cloud-ready* OS type with a nifty *toolbox* layer than runs in a priviledged docker container that can read *root* processes and files.
